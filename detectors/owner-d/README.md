# Owner D detectors (runtime ops)

Contract v1 detectors for Owner D taxonomy checks. The shared input/result
boundary is defined in [`docs/DETECTOR_CONTRACT.md`](../../docs/DETECTOR_CONTRACT.md);
JSON Schema is the source of truth. Detectors here are pure functions over
contract payloads: they never call AWS APIs, and source collection stays outside
the detector.

## INF-01 — Over-provisioning for unforeseen demand spikes

Flags compute resources whose provisioned capacity is never approached by
observed demand: a sustained low average CPU utilization **and** a low observed
peak over a sufficiently long telemetry window. A low average with a high
observed peak is treated as legitimate peak-driven provisioning and is not
flagged.

### Input

A contract v1 `input` payload with one `telemetry` source per scope item. Scope
IDs use the form `resource:<id>`. The telemetry `data` object is a normalized
CloudWatch summary supplied by the connector:

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `resource_id` | Resource identifier; must match the scope (`resource:<id>`) |
| `resource_type` | e.g. `aws_ec2_instance`, `aws_ecs_service` |
| `metric` | `cpu_utilization` (v1 supports only this metric) |
| `provisioned_capacity` / `capacity_unit` | e.g. `8` / `vcpu` |
| `average_utilization` / `peak_utilization` | Fractions of capacity in `[0, 1]` |
| `window_days` / `sample_count` | Telemetry coverage; sufficiency is checked |

### Context settings (all required)

| Setting | Meaning | Reference value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `min_window_days` | Minimum telemetry window | `14` |
| `min_sample_count` | Minimum number of samples | `100` |
| `average_utilization_threshold` | Average below this is suspicious | `0.10` |
| `peak_utilization_threshold` | A peak at/above this is real demand | `0.50` |

Missing or invalid settings make the result `unavailable`.

### Detection rule

A finding is emitted when `window_days >= min_window_days`,
`sample_count >= min_sample_count`, `average_utilization <
average_utilization_threshold` and `peak_utilization <
peak_utilization_threshold`. Both thresholds use strict `<`; equality is not
flagged. Findings cite the exact `average_utilization`, `peak_utilization`,
`provisioned_capacity`, `window_days` and `sample_count` values supplied by the
source, and the fingerprint identity is `cpu-capacity-headroom`. No
energy/emissions measurements are emitted in v1; estimation is deferred to the
estimate engine.

### Run

From the repository root, using Python 3.12 or newer:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/python -m pip install -r shared/contracts/requirements.txt
PYTHONPATH=detectors/owner-d .venv/bin/python -m owner_d.cli \
  detectors/owner-d/tests/fixtures/inf01/inf01-01-positive-input.json
```

The CLI validates the input against the shared contract, evaluates it,
validates the result and its evidence against the input, then prints the result
JSON (`-o FILE` writes to a file instead).

## TST-12 — Heavy fixtures, sleeps and real network calls in unit tests

Flags unit tests whose normalized CI/test-runner artifact shows heavyweight
work: long duration, explicit sleeps, real network calls, oversized fixture
materialization or expensive setup. The detector evaluates artifacts already
produced by the client's CI run; it never executes tests or reaches out to
external services.

### Input

A contract v1 `input` payload with one `artifact` source per scope item. Scope
IDs use the form `test:<test_id>`. The artifact `data` object is a normalized
summary from pytest durations, Jest timing output and optional instrumentation
for waits/network/fixture setup:

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `test_id` | Test identifier; must match the scope (`test:<test_id>`) |
| `framework` | Test runner family, e.g. `pytest`, `jest` |
| `duration_seconds` | Observed wall-clock test duration |
| `sleep_seconds` | Observed or statically detected explicit sleep time |
| `network_call_count` | Real network calls observed during the unit test |
| `fixture_bytes` | Approximate bytes materialized by fixtures |
| `setup_seconds` | Observed setup/fixture time before the assertion body |

### Context settings (all required)

| Setting | Meaning | Reference value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `max_duration_seconds` | Longest acceptable unit-test duration | `10` |
| `max_sleep_seconds` | Explicit sleep allowance | `0` |
| `max_network_calls` | Real network-call allowance | `0` |
| `max_fixture_bytes` | Largest fixture materialization allowance | `10485760` |
| `max_setup_seconds` | Longest acceptable setup/fixture duration | `2` |

Missing or invalid settings make the result `unavailable`.

### Detection rule

A finding is emitted when any observed field is strictly greater than its
matching context maximum. Equality is not flagged. Findings cite the exact
artifact fields that crossed thresholds, plus `duration_seconds` as the
baseline timing observation. The fingerprint identity is `heavy-test-work`.
No energy/emissions measurements are emitted in v1; wall-clock test duration is
not claimed as CPU time.

### Run

Same environment as the INF-01 example above; the CLI routes on `check_id`:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=detectors/owner-d .venv/bin/python -m owner_d.cli \
  detectors/owner-d/tests/fixtures/tst12/tst12-01-positive-input.json
```
